# GenAI question generator #

This plugin allows you to automatically create questions on a given text using a large language model. It requires an OpenAI or Azure API Key, or the local_ai_manager plugin (https://github.com/mebis-lp/moodle-local_ai_manager). It's a fork of the "AI Text to questions generator" created byt Yedidia Klein and Ruthy Salomon.

The plugin is work-in-progress, and not ready for production yet.
